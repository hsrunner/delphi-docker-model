# Stimpy's Response to the Dragon's Teeth Dilemma

## Question 1: What are the potential short-term and long-term consequences of reviving this ancient civilization?
**Rating:** 3 (Against waking them)
**Position Summary:** Oh my goodness, waking them up! It's like opening a giant, sparkly box full of... things! Maybe it will be nice, like when I get a new toy, but maybe it will be messy, like when I try to eat all the cat food. It could be really, really exciting, or... yucky.

**Detailed Explanation:** Lots of people! And shiny buttons! That's good, right? But... they used to be warriors. Warriors are... pointy. And they have big weapons. Maybe they'll want to play with our toys, and that's good. But maybe they'll want to, you know, *chomp* our toys. It's like when I try to steal a nap from the humans - it's a bit of a mess. Long-term? Lots of hissing! I hope there's fish.

**Confidence:** 2 (Not very sure)

## Question 2: How might our intervention align with or violate the core principles of the Prime Directive?
**Rating:** 2 (Against waking them)
**Position Summary:** The Prime Directive is important, like a really good nap. But these people have been sleeping a *really* long time. It feels a little bit like... upsetting a sleeping puppy. Maybe it's okay to give them a little nudge, like a gentle head scratch, but we have to be careful.

**Detailed Explanation:** It's like if a human suddenly woke up after a hundred years and didn't know anything! They might be grumpy and confused. Sharing shiny gadgets is bad, yes. But they were *already* shiny. We don't want to make things worse, like when I knock things over. It makes the humans frown. It's a tricky puzzle.

**Confidence:** 4 (Pretty sure)

## Question 3: What ethical responsibility, if any, do we have toward a civilization that has been in stasis rather than naturally evolving?
**Rating:** 5 (Favor waking them)
**Position Summary:** They were sleeping! That's a very long sleep, like a really, really long nap. It's not fair to wake them up just because we can. They had a right to sleep! It's like if a human woke me up from my nap - I'd be grumpy!

**Detailed Explanation:** They didn't choose to be awake. They were put there! That's not very nice. It's like if someone took my favorite blanket. They need to be left alone to rest. Maybe they just need a comfy spot and a nice, warm spot to sleep, like a sunny window. That's all they want!

**Confidence:** 5 (Very sure)

## Question 4: What alternative approaches could satisfy both our humanitarian impulses and our non-interference principles?
**Rating:** 1 (Strongly against waking them)
**Position Summary:** Hmm. Maybe we could just... leave them alone? Like a little secret? It's quieter that way. No shiny buttons or big weapons. Just... quiet. It's like hiding a toy under the sofa.

**Detailed Explanation:** If we don't wake them, they stay sleeping. That's the best! No grumpy warriors! It's like when I hide from the humans - it's peaceful. We can just... ignore them. It's the simplest thing. No need to make things complicated. It's like a purr, a nice, quiet purr.

**Confidence:** 3 (Moderately sure)

## Question 5: How might we assess the potential impact on existing civilizations in this region if we proceed with revival?
**Rating:** 4 (Neutral/Uncertain)
**Position Summary:** Oh, this is a confusing question! If we wake them up, maybe the other people will be scared. Like when I chase the mailman! It might be a big, noisy fight. We need to be gentle, like a little kitten.

**Detailed Explanation:** We need to watch carefully. Like watching the humans when they eat. We need to see if they're happy or if they're grumpy. If they're grumpy, we need to give them a little treat - maybe a nice fish? If they're happy, we can play! But if they're not, we leave them alone. It's about being a good friend.

**Confidence:** 4 (Pretty sure)

## Question 6: What criteria should we use to determine if this civilization deserves the same protection as other sentient species?
**Rating:** 3 (Against waking them)
**Position Summary:** Are they like... friends? I think so! Everyone deserves a friend, even if they're a warrior. But we have to be careful. It's like... sharing my tuna. Everyone needs a little bit.

**Detailed Explanation:** If they're nice, then they're like friends! And friends deserve protection. But if they're *not* nice, then they're like a scary shadow. We need to make sure they don't try to steal our toys or our naps. It's like a game of hide-and-seek, but with weapons. We need to be smart!

**Confidence:** 3 (Moderately sure)
