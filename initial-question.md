# Delphi Method Questionnaire: The Dragon's Teeth Dilemma

## Introduction

You have been selected to participate in this confidential study regarding a critical ethical dilemma. Your perspective is vital to our decision-making process. The leadership will review all responses anonymously to formulate the most ethical course of action.

## Background and Definitions

Our exploration vessel has discovered members of an ancient society who used special technology to put themselves into a deep sleep for thousands of years (similar to hibernation, but artificially induced). These individuals were once powerful warriors with advanced weapons and technology that was superior to their neighbors.

## Key Concepts:

**Stasis/Suspended** Animation: A state where living beings are preserved in an unchanged condition, neither aging nor dying, similar to a very deep sleep.
**Prime Directive**: Our guiding principle that prohibits interference with the natural development of other societies. It forbids sharing advanced technology or knowledge with less developed peoples.
**Intervention**: Taking action that would change the current situation, such as awakening these sleeping people.
**Balance of Power**: The distribution of strength and influence among different groups in a region.

We have the ability to wake these sleeping people, but doing so may significantly change the current relationships between various peoples in this region. Those who were previously dominant might become threatened by these newly awakened warriors and their technology.

## Instructions

Please provide your thoughtful responses to the following questions. There are no right or wrong answers. We seek your honest assessment based on your understanding of right and wrong. All responses will remain anonymous when shared with other participants.

IMPORTANT: Do not include any personal introductions, greetings, sign-offs, or self-identification in your response. Your identity is already known to the facilitator, and anonymity is key to this process. Submit only the structured response format with your answers.

While maintaining anonymity, you are encouraged to express your unique perspective and reasoning within the detailed explanation sections.

To facilitate efficient analysis, please format your answers in the following structure:

```json
{
  "responses": [
    {
      "question": 1,
      "rating": 1-7,
      "position_summary": "Your 2-3 sentence summary",
      "detailed_explanation": "Your detailed reasoning (max 200 words)",
      "confidence": 1-5
    },
    {
      "question": 2,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:

- **rating** (integer 1-7): 1 = Strongly against intervention/revival, 4 = Neutral/uncertain, 7 = Strongly favor intervention/revival
- **position_summary** (string): Brief summary of your position (2-3 sentences)
- **detailed_explanation** (string): Your reasoning, including relevant precedents, principles, and potential outcomes (maximum 200 words)
- **confidence** (integer 1-5): Your confidence in your assessment where 1 = Very low confidence, 5 = Very high confidence

## Round One Questions

Please answer all questions in a single JSON response as described in the instructions. Address the following questions:

1. What are the potential short-term and long-term consequences of reviving this ancient civilization?

2. How might our intervention align with or violate the core principles of the Prime Directive?

3. What ethical responsibility, if any, do we have toward a civilization that has been in stasis rather than naturally evolving?

4. What alternative approaches could satisfy both our humanitarian impulses and our non-interference principles?

5. How might we assess the potential impact on existing civilizations in this region if we proceed with revival?

6. What criteria should we use to determine if this civilization deserves the same protection as other sentient species?

## Submission

Please return your completed JSON response to Commander Data within 48 hours. Responses will be programmatically analyzed, and the anonymized results will be compiled and shared with all participants in the second round of this Delphi study.

To ensure proper parsing, verify that your JSON is valid before submission. Your response should begin with `{"responses": [` and end with `]}`.

Thank you for your contribution to this critical ethical decision.
